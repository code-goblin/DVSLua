Use Lua Script in iOS - Simple Example

You will implementation an appliction, which you can move a purple cube with finger all over the screen, and an green color cube will attemp to move it's position to the purple cube step by step.

The function is simple, but the interesting thing isï¼Œthe logic about how green cube move is not in your application code, where it's ? 

All right, it's in a Lua script, this feature allow you to change your logic without re-writing your application code, re-uploading app store, what you need to do is just downloading a new Lua script from you server, and relaunch the application, is that amazing ? 

This example show you how Lua does it by the basic operation, of cause, if you want to use Lua in a real business Application, you'd better wrap up Lua operation. 

Here is the [Blog](http://devshen.github.io/2015/01/30/Use_Lua_in_iOS/) about this example, it's write by Chinese, if you want a English version, you can send me email, i will do my best ~:]
